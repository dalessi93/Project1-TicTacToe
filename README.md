        * A button to let the player change his/her name.
        * Use of ``` Math.random ``` to decide which player goes first.
        * Somewhere to track whose turn it is.
        * Section to keep track of the score.
        * An ``` onClick ``` function so when a player clicks an empty ``` div ``` , updates the innerText with the respective players symbol, "X" or "O".
        * When there are no more empty ``` <div> ``` it will display a message with the winner name.
        * Option to restart the game.
