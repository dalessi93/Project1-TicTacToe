# Project1-TicTacToe

## Tech Used
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JS

## Planning
    We will need:
        * HTML document with 9 ` <div> ` divided in a 3x3 grid.
        * Somewhere to keep track of  players turns.
        * Use of ` Math.random ` to decide which player starts the game.
        * An ` onClick ` function so when a player clicks an empty ` div ` , updates the innerText with the respective players symbol, "X" or "O".
        * When there are no more empty ` <div> ` it will display a message with the winner name.
        *Option to restart the game.
        *Option to let the player change his/her name.
        * Deploy game online.
